            <p>The contemporary self-help literature tells us that there is power in being on our own. Love yourself, primarily, and everything else will fall into place. And according to Twitter (sorry, X) and dating apps, relationships don’t look like they once did. Out are eternal vows and nuclear families; in is polyamory, solo date nights and nuclear anxiety. Who needs marriage when you’ve got Feeld, a side hustle and the world is about to end? What’s more, being single has never been such a team sport. Just a few months ago, the Pew Research Centre found that 63 per cent of American men aged 18-29 have, much like 30 per cent of the entire population, got no one to argue about towels with.</p>

            <p>But I am single, and something is wrong. I am outside a pub in London’s Soho, a couple of weeks after I started thinking about writing this story, and I am fielding those questions that come from a friend of a friend of a friend. I’m 34, yeah. No, I don’t have a partner. “What’s wrong with you, then?”
                <br>Well, how long have you got?
                <br>But also: nothing, really, right now. Life’s never been better. I just, you know, don’t have a girlfriend.
            </p>
            <p>Despite the nihilism, I believe in the concept of a monogamous, loving partnership. I’ve had enough casual hook-ups and non-committal relationships to know that it doesn’t work for me. I’d like children one day, if it’s possible. And I would like a girlfriend in the near future, when I am ready, should the opportunity present itself. But I am not on any dating apps (I like the idea of meeting someone IRL). I am single by choice and have been for almost a year.
                <br>I have always been in and out of relationships, so I am gaining strength and happiness from being with myself for a bit. But there is a reason this question didn’t just evaporate into the lazy summer air with all the other random sentences. I feel it on some level. I’m in my thirties and I’m single? Something must be wrong.
            </p>

            <p>Year after year, studies show that men are less happy being single than women. Indeed, unmarried, childless women are the happiest people in society, according to one study, while male loneliness is on the rise.
                <br>I don’t feel lonely, personally, but I know from talking to some single male pals that it can be tough to be out of a relationship. Mr Jon Spiteri is a 64-year-old restaurateur who was married for 16 years and has three children. In January, he came out of a five-year relationship, his longest since his marriage. “I hate it,” he tells me over lunch. “I can’t remember the last time I was single; I tend to go from one relationship to the next.” Historically, this has also been my pattern. “During the week when I’m doing things and working, I meet my friends, I go out for lunch,” he says. “At weekends, I feel this huge loss. I don’t feel like a loser being on my own, I just feel lonely.”

            </blockquote>

            <p>Data suggests that much of what men need from a relationship, women tend to get from their friends. In a 2021 survey, only 21 per cent of men said they received emotional support from a friend in the past week. Apparently, men are still not hot on talking to their mates about feelings. This would explain the huge rise in men’s support groups in recent years.</p>

            <blockquote class="quote">
                <p>“All the emotional support I would get from a partner I have found in my flatmate… It’s an interesting model of a relationship that’s non-traditional”</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>The idea of a “perfect”, conventional relationship, reinforced in culture, is a potent one. It has probably been a factor in me spoiling perfectly good relationships in the past. I have sought perfection (whatever that even means), despite sometimes being way below an ideal partner myself. If we could shake the idea of what things should or could look like, like Denton, we’d be a lot better off. After all, the UK divorce rate is estimated at 42 per cent. Marriage and monogamous, conventional, ever-lasting partnerships are not unobtainable. But they needn’t be a given or a goal.</p>

                <p>“Being single can be super fulfilling. I’m still not sure why that can’t be a lifetime thing”</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Being single clearly means different things, depending on your age. My own vague anxiety may be rooted in the idea that my current stable and carefree situation won’t last forever – so finding someone in the next few years feels significant. But we are back to that idea of things not being linear or predictable, relaxing into our solo status and even redefining what it means. It doesn’t have to represent the absence of something. “I do think [the state of being single] feels somehow temporary,” Denton says. “I do wonder – can we reimagine ways to live together? Being single can be super fulfilling. I’m still not sure why that can’t be a lifetime thing.”</p>
