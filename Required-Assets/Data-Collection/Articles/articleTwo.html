        <article class="article-content">
            <p>Every country the world over has a tradition that fuses nature, science and indigenous healing in a way that encapsulates its culture. Whether you’re submerged in the silica-rich geothermal springs of Iceland or beaten into submission in a Russian banya, an authentic and well-executed spa experience can provide a visceral – and sometimes thoroughly enjoyable – insight into a country’s DNA.
                <br>For example, the hammams of Morocco aren’t just about getting about slathered in mud; they’re a space for pre-prayer ablutions and socialising. Equally, the Mexican temazcal (from which the modern sauna came into being) is a sweat lodge used for ceremonial healing and spiritual connection.
                <br>Of course, not all spas offer mental and metaphysical rejuvenation. Hotel spas in particular have a tendency to sell massages by numbers, making them about as inspiring as the on-site business centre. That’s why we’ve scoured the globe to find the most unique and transformative wellness destinations in operation, and unpacked the experiences they have on offer.

            <h2 class="section-title">Detox in the Alps</h2>
            <h3 class ="section-subtitle">What to know</h3>
            <p>Alpine spas have a distinctly medical bent. So much so that Austrian establishments like Lanserhof and Mayrlife could be mistaken for galactic hospitals. Cutting-edge diagnostics sit alongside newer practices such as psychoneuroimmunology (the interplay of psychological stress and disease) and orthomolecular medicine (better known as nutritional supplementation), but it is the detox treatments that bring everyone to this majestic part of Europe.</p>
            <h3 class ="section-subtitle">Where to go</h3>
            <p>At Mayrlife (formerly VivaMayr), the founding principle is that a fully detoxed body is more adept at self-regeneration. Detoxing, of course, is politically correct wellness speak for controlled fasting. That doesn’t mean no food but it does mean you’ll endure bouts of hangriness before the benefits of a full gut rest kick in. These include better skin, more energy and, crucially, a bolstered immune system (in fact, both Mayrlife and Lanserhof both offer long-Covid programmes for those who have not found relief through mainstream medicine). Fortunately, the landscape is so achingly beautiful – and the celeb spotting so relentless – that your deprivation demons will be thoroughly pacified.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Breathe better in the Cotswolds</h2>
            <h3 class ="section-subtitle">What to know</h3>
            <p>At only an hour from the capital by train, the chocolate box villages of the Cotswolds have become a refuge for burnt-out Londoners in recent years. While this hasn’t delighted locals, it has created demand for some exceptional spas and boutique hotels – and there are some real gems to be found among the soft rolling hills.</p>
            <h3 class ="section-subtitle">Where to go</h3>
            <p>Bamford, Calcot Manor and Barnsley House are all well established, but it is Thyme, a verdant and exquisitely manicured 150-acre manor, that elicits the most joyous of exhales.
                <br>Breathwork and botany take centre stage at the hotel’s Meadow Spa, a serene enclosure within the mini village that never feels crowded or overdone. Ask for the signature ritual in the Botanical Bothy, a private space sculpted from natural resin that’s dedicated to what Thyme calls “conscious diaphragmatic breath” (controlled belly breathing).
                <br>Therapists guide you into a meditative breathing pattern using aromatherapeutic blends from Thyme’s sister brand Bertioli before incorporating pressure point techniques, lymphatic brushing and a very light scalp massage. It’s not a treatment so much as a sensory journey but one that manages to release stress while tangibly boosting sleep, digestion and mood. Like all things at Thyme, the prescription is disarmingly simple but faultlessly executed. To help you integrate the benefits, the ritual ends with an outdoor bath on the secluded veranda.

            <h2 class="section-title">Try panchakarma in the Himalayas</h2>
            <h3 class ="section-subtitle">What to know</h3>
            <p>Panchakarma, literally translated as “five actions”, is the cornerstone of Ayurveda, the system of medicine that originated in the Indian subcontinent over 3,000 years ago. It is not for the faint of heart (or, indeed, gut). Common practices include drinking ghee and irrigating almost every orifice at all-too-regular intervals. It would be a gross oversimplification to think of panchakarma as a cleanse; the aim is to rebalance body, mind and consciousness through diet, herbs and specific treatments.</p>
            <h3 class ="section-subtitle">Where to go</h3>
            <p>Six Senses Vana or Ananda, a former palace in the Himalayan foothills, will provide sufficient cushioning for the experience. Panchakarma can be brutal at times – especially when approaching the finish line – so it makes sense to undergo the strict 21-day protocol in an environment that’s both luxurious and medically sound.
                <br>At Ananda, an Ayurvedic doctor will devise a bespoke programme that includes deeply nourishing therapies such as Abhyanga (a massage performed with sesame oil), and restorative yoga sessions that are a far cry from the calisthenics-inspired aberrations that are so popular in the US and Europe. The personalised diet and herbal supplements aren’t exactly appealing on paper, but the resident chef manages to magic the critical ingredients into a gourmet experience.
