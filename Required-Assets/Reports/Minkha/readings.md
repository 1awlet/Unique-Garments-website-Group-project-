"This involved some typical tasks suggested for e-commerce websites in earlier studies(e.g. Brincket al.2001, Kuniavsky 2003) such as finding products (tasks 1 and 4); finding information(tasks 8 and 9); purchasing products (tasks 2 and 4);using the site’s search engine (tasks 6 and 10); and dealing with complaints (task 7). Tasks 3 and 5 were included to reflect the need to offer facilities for customers to change their orders and/or user profile"
