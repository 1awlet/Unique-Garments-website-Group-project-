    articleTitle: "Is It Actually OK To Be Single?",

    introPassage:"The contemporary self-help literature tells us that there is power in being on our own. Love yourself, primarily, and everything else will fall into place. And according to Twitter (sorry, X) and dating apps, relationships dont look like they once did. Out are eternal vows and nuclear families; in is polyamory, solo date nights and nuclear anxiety. Who needs marriage when you have got Feeld, a side hustle and the world is about to end? Whats more, being single has never been such a team sport. Just a few months ago, the Pew Research Centre found that 63 per cent of American men aged 18-29 have, much like 30 per cent of the entire population, got no one to argue about towels with.",
    firstPassage:"But I am single, and something is wrong. I am outside a pub in Londons Soho, a couple of weeks after I started thinking about writing this story, and I am fielding those questions that come from a friend of a friend of a friend. Im 34, yeah. No, I dont have a partner. “Whats wrong with you, then?” Well, how long have you got? But also: nothing, really, right now. Life's never been better. I just, you know, dont have a girlfriend. Despite the nihilism, I believe in the concept of a monogamous, loving partnership. I have had enough casual hook-ups and non-committal relationships to know that it does not work for me. I wouldd like children one day, if its possible. And I would like a girlfriend in the near future, when I am ready, should the opportunity present itself. But I am not on any dating apps (I like the idea of meeting someone IRL). I am single by choice and have been for almost a year. I have always been in and out of relationships, so I am gaining strength and happiness from being with myself for a bit. But there is a reason this question didnt just evaporate into the lazy summer air with all the other random sentences. I feel it on some level. I am in my thirties and I am single? Something must be wrong.Year after year, studies show that men are less happy being single than women. Indeed, unmarried, childless women are the happiest people in society, according to one study, while male loneliness is on the rise. I dont feel lonely, personally, but I know from talking to some single male pals that it can be tough to be out of a relationship. Mr Jon Spiteri is a 64-year-old restaurateur who was married for 16 years and has three children. In January, he came out of a five-year relationship, his longest since his marriage. “I hate it,” he tells me over lunch. “I cant remember the last time I was single; I tend to go from one relationship to the next.” Historically, this has also been my pattern. “During the week when I am doing things and working, I meet my friends, I go out for lunch,” he says. “At weekends, I feel this huge loss. I don't feel like a loser being on my own, I just feel lonely.”",
    firstQuote:"“I am in my thirties and I am single? Something must be wrong”",
    secondPassage:"Data suggests that much of what men need from a relationship, women tend to get from their friends. In a 2021 survey, only 21 per cent of men said they received emotional support from a friend in the past week. Apparently, men are still not hot on talking to their mates about feelings. This would explain the huge rise in mens support groups in recent years.",
    secondQuote:"“All the emotional support I would get from a partner I have found in my flatmate… It's an interesting model of a relationship thats non-traditional”",
    thirdPassage:"The idea of a “perfect”, conventional relationship, reinforced in culture, is a potent one. It has probably been a factor in me spoiling perfectly good relationships in the past. I have sought perfection (whatever that even means), despite sometimes being way below an ideal partner myself. If we could shake the idea of what things should or could look like, like Denton, we'd be a lot better off. After all, the UK divorce rate is estimated at 42 per cent. Marriage and monogamous, conventional, ever-lasting partnerships are not unobtainable. But they need not be a given or a goal.",
    thirdQuote:"“Being single can be super fulfilling. I'm still not sure why that can't be a lifetime thing”",
    finalPassage:"Being single clearly means different things, depending on your age. My own vague anxiety may be rooted in the idea that my current stable and carefree situation won't last forever  so finding someone in the next few years feels significant. But we are back to that idea of things not being linear or predictable, relaxing into our solo status and even redefining what it means. It doesn't have to represent the absence of something. “I do think [the state of being single] feels somehow temporary,” Denton says. “I do wonder can we reimagine ways to live together? Being single can be super fulfilling. I'm still not sure why that can't be a lifetime thing.”"

    introPassage:"Every country the world over has a tradition that fuses nature, science and indigenous healing in a way that encapsulates its culture. Whether you're submerged in the silica-rich geothermal springs of Iceland or beaten into submission in a Russian banya, an authentic and well-executed spa experience can provide a visceral  and sometimes thoroughly enjoyable  insight into a country's DNA. For example, the hammams of Morocco arent just about getting about slathered in mud; they are a space for pre-prayer ablutions and socialising. Equally, the Mexican temazcal (from which the modern sauna came into being) is a sweat lodge used for ceremonial healing and spiritual connection. Of course, not all spas offer mental and metaphysical rejuvenation. Hotel spas in particular have a tendency to sell massages by numbers, making them about as inspiring as the on-site business centre. That's why we've scoured the globe to find the most unique and transformative wellness destinations in operation, and unpacked the experiences they have on offer.At Mayrlife (formerly VivaMayr), the founding principle is that a fully detoxed body is more adept at self-regeneration. Detoxing, of course, is politically correct wellness speak for controlled fasting. That doesn't mean no food but it does mean you'll endure bouts of hangriness before the benefits of a full gut rest kick in. These include better skin, more energy and, crucially, a bolstered immune system (in fact, both Mayrlife and Lanserhof both offer long-Covid programmes for those who have not found relief through mainstream medicine). Fortunately, the landscape is so achingly beautiful and the celeb spotting so relentless  that your deprivation demons will be thoroughly pacified.",
    firstPassage:"Alpine spas have a distinctly medical bent. So much so that Austrian establishments like Lanserhof and Mayrlife could be mistaken for galactic hospitals. Cutting-edge diagnostics sit alongside newer practices such as psychoneuroimmunology (the interplay of psychological stress and disease) and orthomolecular medicine (better known as nutritional supplementation), but it is the detox treatments that bring everyone to this majestic part of Europe.",
    firstQuote:"Detox in the Alps",
    secondPassage:"At only an hour from the capital by train, the chocolate box villages of the Cotswolds have become a refuge for burnt-out Londoners in recent years. While this hasn't delighted locals, it has created demand for some exceptional spas and boutique hotels and there are some real gems to be found among the soft rolling hills.Bamford, Calcot Manor and Barnsley House are all well established, but it is Thyme, a verdant and exquisitely manicured 150-acre manor, that elicits the most joyous of exhales. Breathwork and botany take centre stage at the hotel's Meadow Spa, a serene enclosure within the mini village that never feels crowded or overdone. Ask for the signature ritual in the Botanical Bothy, a private space sculpted from natural resin that's dedicated to what Thyme calls “conscious diaphragmatic breath” (controlled belly breathing). Therapists guide you into a meditative breathing pattern using aromatherapeutic blends from Thyme's sister brand Bertioli before incorporating pressure point techniques, lymphatic brushing and a very light scalp massage. It's not a treatment so much as a sensory journey but one that manages to release stress while tangibly boosting sleep, digestion and mood. Like all things at Thyme, the prescription is disarmingly simple but faultlessly executed. To help you integrate the benefits, the ritual ends with an outdoor bath on the secluded veranda.",
    secondQuote:"Breathe better in the Cotswolds",
    thirdPassage:"Panchakarma, literally translated as “five actions”, is the cornerstone of Ayurveda, the system of medicine that originated in the Indian subcontinent over 3,000 years ago. It is not for the faint of heart (or, indeed, gut). Common practices include drinking ghee and irrigating almost every orifice at all-too-regular intervals. It would be a gross oversimplification to think of panchakarma as a cleanse; the aim is to rebalance body, mind and consciousness through diet, herbs and specific treatments.",
    thirdQuote:"Six Senses Vana or Ananda, a former palace in the Himalayan foothills, will provide sufficient cushioning for the experience. Panchakarma can be brutal at times  especially when approaching the finish line so it makes sense to undergo the strict 21-day protocol in an environment that's both luxurious and medically sound. At Ananda, an Ayurvedic doctor will devise a bespoke programme that includes deeply nourishing therapies such as Abhyanga (a massage performed with sesame oil), and restorative yoga sessions that are a far cry from the calisthenics-inspired aberrations that are so popular in the US and Europe. The personalised diet and herbal supplements aren't exactly appealing on paper, but the resident chef manages to magic the critical ingredients into a gourmet experience.",

    introPassage:"Is there a more potent symbol of the tragically emasculated man than Barbie's on-again, off-again boyfriend, Kenneth Sean Carson? Ever since emerging from his toybox in 1961, Ken, as he's known to his coterie of mostly female friends, has been the subject of incessant ridicule, labelled as a beta male whose smooth, featureless crotch isn't just his most recognisable feature, but a physical metaphor for his general lack of manhood. It's not just Ken's sex organs that are missing: his entire personality is neutered, a pale shadow of the testosterone-fuelled hypermasculinity represented by GI Joe or He-Man. Who better, then, to act as an alternative role model for modern men?With Barbie  and, to a lesser extent, Ken  dominating the zeitgeist thanks to this month's hotly anticipated live-action Barbie movie, we thought that it was high time to give this much-maligned figure a reappraisal, and perhaps to see if we couldn't learn a couple of life lessons along the way. After all, in an era when the topic of what it means to be a man has never been more hotly debated, and traditional views on masculinity are increasingly seen as a source of toxicity, should we not all be asking ourselves: what would Ken do?",
    firstPassage:"Sure, Ken's sculpted torso might look like the result of thermoplastic poured into a mould, but it's actually down to a rigid and uncompromising fitness regimen. Don't believe us? Just look at the variety of personas he has adopted over the years: 1981's Jogging Ken, 1983's Great Shape Ken and 1989's Workout Ken reveal him as no stranger to the gym. And it's not just plastic Ken who doesn't skip leg day; it turns out that live-action Ken has been putting in the hours, too. The doll is depicted in the upcoming movie by Mr Ryan Gosling, a famously good-looking man, but an actor who was 41 years old at the time of filming. Despite this, the movie appears to have captured him in the shape of his life. The results, if reports are to be believed, of a gruelling five-day-a-week workout plan. That's not to mention the peroxide, the fake tan, the body waxing and the teeth whitening that were required to complete the look. Is Ken someone we should aspire to look like? Absolutely not: you only need to google “Human Ken Doll” to see what happens when we attempt to replicate, in flesh and bone, a level of perfection only possible in plastic. Nonetheless, we could all learn something from Ken's 60-year dedication to fitness and personal grooming. Indeed, far from an expression of vanity, the pursuit of self-betterment can be considered a moral imperative. As Socrates wrote, “It is a shame for a man to grow old without seeing the beauty and strength of which his body is capable.”",
    firstQuote:"Embrace male beauty",
    secondPassage:"“This is a man's world,” sang Mr James Brown. It's safe to assume that he wasn't talking about the Barbie universe, a place where patriarchal hierarchies are upended and male dolls act as little more than accessories to their more popular female counterparts. Conceived by his creators at Mattel as a romantic companion to Barbie, Ken has played a supporting role from the very start, defined not by his personal qualities, but by his relation to someone else. A more fragile ego might have resented this subordinate status, but not Ken, who has lived in Barbie's orbit happily for more than six decades, content to fill his days at the beach, at the gym, or pursuing one of his many hobbies. Barbie is a complicated female role model, to say the least. While she may have taught little girls that they can be anything they want, in doing so providing an early precursor to the Girl Power movement of the 1990s, she has also promoted unrealistic beauty standards with her impossibly exaggerated proportions and permanently en-pointe feet. Ken isn't perfect, either. His recent on-screen portrayals, in both Barbie and Toy Story 3, have exposed the flaws and fragilities that many men suffer from. Beneath it all, though, he is a sympathetic character, and a model for a new, progressive kind of masculinity. Supportive, uncompetitive, willing to subvert traditional gender roles, and also really into pink. Speaking of which…",
    secondQuote:"Support the women in your life",
    thirdPassage:"The celebrity style on show on the red sorry, pink carpet at the Barbie premiere in Los Angeles this month might prove to be the tipping point in the nascent Barbiecore trend, dragging it from the pages of fashion magazines and into mainstream consciousness. We're talking in particular about the soft-pink Gucci suit and silk shirt worn by Gosling, but special mention also goes to Messrs Michael Cera and Xolo Maridueña, who both offered their own interpretations on the trend. Barbiecore, which takes the all-pink colour scheme of the Barbie universe and applies it to the real world, follows the “millennial pink” trend of 2016 in bringing wider acceptance to what has historically been considered an effeminate colour. But while millennial pink referred to a specific shade of dusty rose  it even had a Pantone code  Barbiecore offers a much broader spectrum of colour, ranging from fuschia and bubblegum-pink to the peachy tones of Gosling's suit. (At a stretch, you could also include the lavender jacket worn by Mr Mark Ronson at the premiere.) While ultimately about fun and frivolity, this look is also about confidence (Ken-fidence?). The “pink is for girls” argument might seem frivolous and outdated, but it is rooted in decades of social tradition, and there are plenty who still subscribe to it. There will be haters but what meaningful trend ever came without an element of transgression?",

    articleTitle:"The Experts' Guide To Looking After Your Hair This Summer",

    articlePicture:"https://res.cloudinary.com/ddeif6hmk/image/upload/v1692798128/articleimg4_cd9kc8.jpg",
    introPassage:"Summer is the season of expectation. When the vacation we've been yearning for, the beach body we may (or may not) have been working on, and the chance to relax in the sun finally all comes to fruition. Follicularly speaking, though, summer is arguably the cruellest season to deal with. Hot weather can spell trouble for even the most fastidiously groomed coif. From harmful UV rays to frizz-causing humidity, sweat and melting products, a good hair day can turn bad as soon as you're out of the comfort of the AC. In short, your usual haircare routine likely won't cut it when the mercury starts to rise. To help that summer glow extend to the very tip of your head, we spoke to some experts for some summer hair tips to follow.",
    firstPassage:"The first step in preparing a robust summer haircare routine is to understand that everybody's hair will respond to the heat differently. “For some people, it will mean they perspire more, so their hair might get greasy,” says London-based hair stylist and groomer Ms Natalie Shafii. “While for other people, it will make their hair dry and brittle, especially if it is blond or bleached. And if you frequently go swimming, the chlorine or sea can dry the hair out, too.”Depending on which type camp you fall into  and how much time by the pool or sea you plan to spend  will affect how you switch up your routine. Which brings us to…",
    firstQuote:"Know your hair type",
    secondPassage:"“Curly hair will often get bigger and puffier in humid weather, whereas straighter, finer hair might get limper and greasier,” Shafii says. If you have natural curls or waves that tend to get wilder in the heat, a curl cream or oil will help tame the frizz, while finer, or straighter hair will benefit from a texturising hair powder to absorb the scalp's natural oils and keep everything looking on point.A salt spray is an easy summer go-to if you struggle with greasier looking hair in the summer. “It will add a bit of texture and go with that beachy feel rather than trying to work against it,” Shafii says.",
    secondQuote:"Handle humidity accordingly",
    thirdPassage:"Thought sun protection was just for your face and body? Not quite. “Just like you would protect the rest of your skin from the sun, it's important to shield your scalp as well, especially if you have thinning hair or a visible scalp,” says Mr Jeffrey Laub, co-founder of NYC men's haircare brand Blind Barber. For this, he recommends applying a sunscreen specifically designed for the scalp, which will be formulated to stop hair getting weighed down.Or you could get creative with your sun cream and use it as a styling product. “It won't have as much hold obviously,” Shafii says. “But if you have shorter hair, it can be a great way to add some texture and is great for protecting the skin.”The experts tip if you cant get your hands on an SPF you like? Have a hat handy. As well as being a failsafe for protecting your scalp from harmful sun rays, it's just the thing for a bad hair day.",

    articlePicture:"https://res.cloudinary.com/ddeif6hmk/image/upload/v1692798128/articleimg5_g0x6pl.jpg",
    introPassage:"At times, it can seem like watchmakers are on a quest to cram as much microscopic machinery into a 40mm case as possible. Calendars, chronographs, repeaters and tourbillons  the capacity of high-end horology to dazzle with detail never ends. But is it best? Is there actually something to be said for the simpler designs? Where hour, minutes and seconds are left alone to do what they do best. Two watch experts go head-to-head to make their arguments.",
    firstPassage:"Too often, we fall easily into the fallacy that more  even more of a good thing  equals better. But any car nut will agree that you can have more fun in a manual, petrol-powered Lotus Elise than a two-tonne hybrid hypercar. The Lotus founder Mr Colin Chapman lived by the motto “simplify and add lightness”. Like all good engineers, he knew that less is more.Many a watch brand will boast of the number of individual parts contained within its latest grand complication, sometimes thousands of them. But anyone with a degree of mechanical, or mathematical, sympathy knows that the most beautiful form is the one with the fewest components, the one that achieves its goal with the minimum amount of effort.More complications on your watch inevitably means more things that can go wrong. Not that I am calling into question the build quality of Switzerland's finest, but by and large it is the three-hand automatics that you would comfortably take to the beach, rather than the minute repeaters and split-second chronographs.",
    firstQuote:"IN PRAISE OF SIMPLE WATCHES",
    secondPassage:"Lest you think I am casting aside the last 70 years of watchmaking in one sentence, I will caveat my argument slightly: there is such a thing as elegant complexity. Witness the aesthetic created by Ressence, or the approach taken by the likes of Ochs und Junior and H. Moser & Cie. to perpetual calendars and tourbillons. Do you need to know today's date, and that alone, or do you need to be shown every possible date in the year with a tiny arrow pointing to the information you want? The problem is not so much with mechanically sophisticated watches, but a design language that flaunts complexity for its own sake. Time to get back to basics.",
    secondQuote:"“The most beautiful form is the one with the fewest components, the one that achieves its goal with the minimum amount of effort”",
    thirdPassage:"If you were once that kid who took things apart to see how they worked (I make no claims about successfully putting anything back together), then you will almost certainly derive a great deal of pleasure from the ingenuity behind even the most basic watch movement and the mechanical methods used to store and release energy in a uniform, constant manner. It's genius, plain and simple and the only thing better is, well, more.",
    thirdQuote:"THE ARGUMENT FOR COMPLICATED WATCHES",
    finalPassage:"Start bringing these complications together to form a grand complication and movements become labyrinthine three-dimensional marvels, miniature horological citadels formed of hundreds and hundreds of tiny components, which, at this level, will be decorated to the highest standards  a dizzying mélange of black-polished and blued screws, hand-polished bevelled edges, Geneva stripes and perlage. From here, simple watchmaking looks, visually at least, too easy. At the highest, most complicated levels of watchmaking, each of the hundreds of hours lavished on a watch during its creation is all too evident."

    articlePicture:"https://res.cloudinary.com/ddeif6hmk/image/upload/v1692798128/articleimg6_oc34to.jpg",
    introPassage:"In the year of King Charles's coronation, Britain also commemorates the seventy-fifth anniversary of Windrush, the generation of Caribbean people who arrived in the UK between 1948 and 1973 and suffered at the hands of Britain's unethical immigration system; it's safe to say that this is a country with a complicated cultural identity. From classical performances to garage raves, British culture runs the gamut from historic traditions to fresh new perspectives. This spread is peppered with pithy cultural archetypes that are, at least on the surface, recognizable to an international audience, but on a deeper level, wholly unfamiliar. The ability to reference and explore these famous subcultural phenomena is, perhaps, what makes English sartorial history such a central focus on FW23 runways.",
    firstPassage:"Although this trend asserted itself in FW23, the writing has been on the wall for several seasons. From the unbridled success of Wales Bonner's exploration of silhouettes like the adidas Samba and retro tracksuits to TikTok's blokecore revolution, in which American 20-somethings took passionately to a style popularized by fashion-hating football fans, British style has proven to be an attractive force even for international audiences. If FW23 presentations were anything to go by, this trend is showing no signs of slowing. So, before you don a kilt and a Stone Island jacket for a trip to the pub, make sure you know your punks from your blokes.",
    firstQuote:"BLOKES",
    secondPassage:"To the dismay of many Brits, one of the most prolific TikTok style trends of the last few years has been blokecore: the art of dressing like a bloke. Think vintage football tops, jeans, and adidas footwear. While 2020 may have been your local TikTok star's first taste of this cocktail, it's a subculture deeply entrenched in British life. Sure, Elijah Wood was reluctantly welcomed into the world by the scene's chosen one, Danny Dyer, in 2005's seminal film Green Street, but the roots of this culture stretch back decades before that. Since the late ‘80s, England has been the home of Casuals, British lads who started traveling the world (Western Europe) to watch football, picking up—lawfully or otherwise—gear in these new cities. The clothing they brought shaped the exclusive aesthetic of the subculture, with European labels like C.P. Company, Stone Island, Lacoste, and more becoming commonplace signifiers of a lifestyle beyond just watching football. ",
    secondQuote:"ENGLISH ROSE",
    thirdPassage:"From the athletic silhouettes of blokecore to audacious tartan kilts and loud punk styling, British culture's variety is what makes it such rich source material for designers. It also means it's easy to slot into as a customer. For those looking to play with the more elegant side of British identity—we're talking Keira Knightley in Pride & Prejudice—then the English rose trope is key.The red rose is England's national flower, symbolizing much, ranging from the fifteenth-century Wars of the Roses to the simple, unspoiled natural beauty of the isle's landscapes. During FW23 presentations, different configurations of the rose continued to surface, tapping into this symbolic power.",
    thirdQuote:"Punk needs no introduction. It's been one of Britain's defining subcultures over the last century. Emerging in the 1970s as a rebellion against conservative British politics, the culture is most famous for its music and style. Artists like the Sex Pistols and The Clash soundtracked the era of wild haircuts, drainpipe jeans, beaten leather jackets, and heavy leather boots. Punk's expression in fashion walks hand in hand with the kilt trend, as kilts have long been part of the punk uniform. It tracks, then, that Vivienne Westwood is a protagonist in punk style language, having shaped the look alongside Malcolm McLaren at Let It Rock, an iconic punk store in West London. ",
    finalPassage:"What's perhaps most fascinating about fashion's carving up of British style is the reluctance of any of these legitimate subcultures to be marketed. The cultural importance of wearing a kilt for those who have grown up doing so makes it a bold statement in a nonceremonial situation. As for blokes, they're about as far from the world of TikTok trends as any modern human could be, and that's an active decision. Punk has long been a subculture based on deep-rooted, anti-capitalist philosophy that stretches much further than tartan trousers and a leather jacket; it's a lifestyle. It's this kind of pride in the exclusivity of subculture, though, that makes British style so interesting. While fashion digs into Britain's current visible style makeup, there's a basement, studio, or club somewhere in the UK right now that's building something new, and we know nothing about it. Yet. "

    articlePicture:"https://res.cloudinary.com/ddeif6hmk/image/upload/v1692798128/articleimg7_wffein.jpg",
    introPassage:"As someone who coruns a “celebrity book club,” I am often asked the same question with equal parts desperation and excitement: What should I read next? This question is no more prevalent than in the summer, when it seems like everyone is looking for the definitive It Book or hot summer read. This summer, the question got me thinking about what “It” is and what makes something or someone inherently It.The invention of the term It Girl is widely credited to the British novelist Elinor Glyn, who used “it” as a euphemism for sex in her novella of the same name, which was serialized in Cosmopolitan in 1927 and later became a silent film starring Clara Bow. In the beginning of the silent film, Glyn is featured and explains, in a title card, that: “Self-confidence and indifference as to whether you are pleasing or not—and something in you that gives the impression that you are not all cold. That's ‘IT'!”",
    firstPassage:"Candy Darling was a quintessential figure in Warhol's Factory and Warhol's films of the late 1960s. In many ways, the '60s and '70s encapsulate the second wave of It—a time when counterculture was the culture and a select few women, like Darling, were redefining ideas of womanhood. Nicole Flattery's book attempts and succeeds in reflecting upon womanhood at that time as well. Despite Warhol and his factory being well-trodden territory, Flattery's sardonic coming-of-age novel, which follows two schoolgirls tasked with typing up Warhol's recorded tapes, is fresh in that it is about a fictional character reflecting on her youth and only happens to take place in and around The Factory. Flattery's novel is a perfect pairing with Darling in that they capture the intriguing lifeblood of the 1960s and early 1970s. ",
    firstQuote:"Ayo Edebiri, actress / Francisco by Alison Mills Newman (New Directions)",
    secondPassage:"Ayo Edebiri is everything everywhere all at once. She rose to prominence in her role as Sydney Adamu on FX's The Bear and will star in the feature film Bottoms later this summer. If It can be defined as an indifference to whether you are pleasing or not, then Edebiri is It. She feels thoroughly modern as an actress because she is both youthful and complex; emotional but not overly serious, which can probably be attributed to her standup comedy roots. It feels natural to pair Edebiri with Francisco, which is an old book with a new life. Alison Mills Newman's novel, originally published in 1974, is the story of a young woman who falls in love with a filmmaker in San Francisco. Newman's novel does not shy away from sexual frankness, but it is much more than that. It is about intimacy and about a woman trying to find her vocation in a difficult-to-navigate world. Both Edebiri and Francisco possess a timelessness that feels like a requirement for It status.",
    secondQuote:"Fran Lebowitz, writer / Mrs. S by K Patrick (Europa Editions)",
    thirdPassage:"Our recent Franaissance could be a result of two documentaries in the past ten years, a robust public speaking calendar, and renewed interest in Lebowitz's earlier work, but what is more likely is that Lebowitz possesses a primordial cool that firmly cements her It status. Mrs. S by K Patrick follows The Matron, a butch lesbian who has been tasked with overseeing an English boarding school. Things become interesting when the matron falls for the headmaster's wife, Mrs. S. This novel pairs well with Lebowitz's overt masculinity and her less-discussed lesbianism, but also is wry enough to live up to the insanely high comedic bar Lebowitz has set since she first published Metropolitan Life in 1978.",
    thirdQuote:"Greta Lee, actress / Y/N by Esther Yi (Astra House)",
    finalPassage:"Greta Lee has made a name for herself with many offbeat roles over the past ten years, but the recent success of Past Lives, Celine Song's film about a Korean-Canadian playwright whose life is upended when she reconnects with her childhood sweetheart, has skyrocketed Lee to a new tier of acting stardom. Esther Yi's novel Y/N is about a Korean woman who begins writing fan fiction about a K-pop star named Moon. When Moon suddenly retires, the narrator of the novel picks up and goes to Korea in search of Moon and love. If there's a role we'd love to see Lee sink her teeth into, it would be this one."

    introPassage:"Are they friends or partners? Where did they get that food and how have they managed to keep their beers so cold? But most importantly, what's in their beach bag? This summer, we're lifting the curtain and getting a peek at what some of our favorite creatives are lugging to the sandy shores.",
    firstPassage:"I'm having a no-sun summer. My skin is sensitive and I want to look like a plump teen forever, so I'm wearing this mask eight hours out of the day. I swear, if one ray even touches my forehead.... Oh, so you thought I was being cute and kidding about not having any UVs even look at my supple body? Yeah, right! I'm toting along a Burberry umbrella with me for extra coverage. Also, I love the naughty proper check. Reminds me of Posh Spice in, like, 2002.",

    introPassage:"How derivative is too derivative? Imitation, viewed in a certain light, is flattery; in another, it's theft. Since new tools were made accessible to the public in late 2022, AI art has taken off; my social media feeds are saturated with it. Some artists have made novel pieces with these tools—fashion photographer Charlie Engman harnesses them to create surreal works whose aesthetics neatly fit in his preexisting oeuvre, while St4ngeThing generated streetwear inspired by Renaissance era fashions. Vaquera published gothic images of an eerie runway proclaiming “FASHION IS DEAD.”",
    firstPassage:"To start, artificial intelligence might be a misnomer. There are two popular forms of “artificial intelligence” right now: generative pretrained transformers (GPTs) and diffusion models—both forms of artificial neural networks (ANNs). GPTs are the most common type of ANNs at the moment. They're the ones responsible for the most successful text-based “AI” programs. OpenAI's ChatGPT has been wildly popular, with over 100 million users at the time of writing. I've been using it to practice my French and a friend used it to write copy for his startup. Unlike previous language processors, which were trained solely on text considered relevant to their given task, GPTs are trained on large and generalized swaths of text and only later given specific directives.",

    thirdPassage:"Diffusion models, like Stable Diffusion and DALL-E 2, are ANNs that focus instead on generating images. They're trained on endless images which are all associated with certain text descriptions. They're then given a “noise” image that essentially looks like old-school television static. From there, they're instructed to find an image in the noise. If you've ever looked at clouds and saw a face, or stared at the ceiling too long and started seeing strange images emerge, you've essentially done the same. Given the way they function, I don't think it's fair to call either of these models truly intelligent. They are not sufficiently self-aware. Even if you ask Stable Diffusion or ChatGPT to define themselves, they are not truly, deeply self-referential as an integral part of their makeup. If ChatGPT had spent a great deal of time being trained on itself and conversations it had with others, then trained onward and onward on its reflections (or outputs) on that data, then perhaps it might be slowly heading towards consciousness.",

    finalPassage:"Caroline Caldwell, a friend who's an illustrator and a tattoo artist, told me her designs are already frequently lifted by graphic designers creating labels for edgy beer brands or inspirational shirts. She was worried AI will only make this problem worse. She's barely scraping by, pained and frustrated. For her, art is about making something human, something connective. Of course AI art could be used to make appealing imagery, she said, but could it make something that genuinely made someone feel understood, seen, less alone? We can look at these images as just a collection of pixels, judge them on purely aesthetic appeal, but for so many people, the human element behind the art is actually the most important. It's not just about looking at an image; it's about connecting with someone, maybe even feeling the same thing they do."
